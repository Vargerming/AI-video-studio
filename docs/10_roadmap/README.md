# MVP Roadmap (draft)

## MVP definition (for now)
A minimal pipeline that can repeatedly produce a short video segment with:
- script → voice → subtitles → video assembly
- QC: <=30s fragments + final review
- basic logging of inputs/outputs

## Hospital-phase deliverables (no laptop)
1) Repo structure + templates
2) Roadmap skeleton with milestones
3) QC baseline docs
4) Decision log discipline

## Next (when laptop returns)
- Import Sacred JSON
- Create minimal runnable pipeline repo (separate if needed)
- Connect to GitLab if GitLab is the source-of-truth
